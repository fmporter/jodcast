The Jodcast's code has remained largely untouched since it was created in 2006, and some of it would benefit from a bit of reworking.

All the original Jodcast code can be found on external at /scratch/almanas/jodcast_backup/jodcast_1/jodcast/. The show-making code is located in several directories within jodcast, with the sections uploaded here found in the following locations:

raw/CreateShow: CreateShow.py, MakeCoverArt2016.py, Params.py, ProcessAudio.py
